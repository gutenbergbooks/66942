<p>
The pictures here depicted, show the whole process of building a
middle class house, from the selection and sawing of timbers until
they are formed into a complete house. The head carpenter conferring
with the owner, plans the form and design of the house.
</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_01jpg">
  <img src="images/img_01.jpg" alt="" title="" />
    <p class="works">
      The head carpenter first makes a calculation of the quantity of
      timber necessary to complete the building and so much timber is
      carried to the spot where the house will be built. Here the head
      carpenter has to use his talent seriously for choosing the timbers,
      appropriate for poles, upper and lower beams, railings and halls,
      etc., so that the best pieces of wood are used for the principal
      rooms and in the places that attract attention. Thus, he is ordering
      the sawyers to saw the timbers in the way he thinks the best.
    </p>
</div>


<div class="figcenter" id="i_02jpg">
  <img src="images/img_02.jpg" alt="" title="" />
    <p class="works">
      Here the men are sharpening the saws for the sawyers, which is a
      peculiar occupation belonging to themselves.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_03jpg">
  <img src="images/img_03.jpg" alt="" title="" />
    <p class="works">
      Next, the carpenter shaves the wood that have been cut by the sawyers.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_04jpg">
  <img src="images/img_04.jpg" alt="" title="" />
    <p class="works">
      After the boards are so planed for the different poles, upper and
      lower beams, railings etc., they are again to be carefully shaved
      with carpenter’s skill before they are put in their proper
      position.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_05jpg">
  <img src="images/img_05.jpg" alt="" title="" />
    <p class="works">
      The carpenter has to keep his tools very sharp for doing this
      skillful work so that he has to sharpen them frequently while he is
      working.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_06jpg">
  <img src="images/img_06.jpg" alt="" title="" />
    <p class="works">
      Each carpenter brings his “bento” or “luncheon case” filled with
      boiled rice and some other trifles, when he comes to the work place,
      in the morning. Here they open the case at tiffin time and enjoy
      themselves.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_07jpg">
  <img src="images/img_07.jpg" alt="" title="" />
    <p class="works">
      The stone masons take their parts for the foundation work of the house.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_08jpg">
  <img src="images/img_08.jpg" alt="" title="" />
    <p class="works">
      The incessant work of ten of the carpenters for two months has so
      progressed that every pole and railing is properly planed and
      skillfully shaped, measured and holed so that each piece fits the
      other so as to complete the building or framing of the house. Here
      they are making the preparation for the building or framing work.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_09jpg">
  <img src="images/img_09.jpg" alt="" title="" />
    <p class="works">
      The building or framing work should be completed in a whole day. This
      is the most important day for the carpenters; for, has there been
      even the slightest error in measuring or making holes, the building
      work will become impossible.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_10jpg">
  <img src="images/img_10.jpg" alt="" title="" />
    <p class="works">
      The building or framing being almost constructed, they now have to
      carry the heaviest head pillars up above by using the pulley.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_11jpg">
  <img src="images/img_11.jpg" alt="" title="" />
    <p class="works">
      After hard labour taken by the carpenters and coolies, employed
      specially for the day of building, under an earnest management of the
      head carpenter, the building or framing work is completed at sunset.
      The celebration poles are made each bearing three fans indicating
      type of rising sun, fastened together and decorated with green
      leaves, five coloured hemp threads and white paper cut in the way
      indicating sacredness. And the carpenters carry them, making a
      procession together with the coolies singing songs celebrating the
      success. Then they stop first at the gate of the owner of the new
      building and leave there, one of the decorations, and the family
      gives them a feast and “sake” for the celebration.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_12jpg">
  <img src="images/img_12.jpg" alt="" title="" />
    <p class="works">
      When a temple or a very high class house is built, a solemn ceremony
      takes place by Shinto priests. Also, in this ceremony, the chief
      carpenters who are attired in Shinto priest’s costume, ceremonially
      use the measure and spooled marking ink over the main pole of the
      building.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_13jpg">
  <img src="images/img_13.jpg" alt="" title="" />
    <p class="works">
      Now the tile men commence roofing and coolies make walls with bamboo
      which shall be plastered afterward, by the plasterer.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_14jpg">
  <img src="images/img_14.jpg" alt="" title="" />
    <p class="works">
      The roofing is nearly completed. The coolies and plasterer are busy
      outside and the carpenters are busy with inside works.

<div class="figcenter" id="i_16jpg">
  <img src="images/img_16.jpg" alt="" title="" />
    <p class="works">
      Both inside and outside works are nearly finished and the mat-men are
      to take their parts trimming the mats so to fit each room. They have
      to manage more than 60 “Tatami” or mats for this house.

    <p class="works">
      The house is done but the whole household are kept busy for sometime,
      pasting papers over the “Shoji” (doors of rooms), and many other
      little jobs are waiting to be finished before the family may
      comfortably enjoy the new house.

      This is one of the best rooms, intentionally made for receiving
      guests. Artistic and expensive woods are used for the poles and floor
      of the “Tokonoma,” or, place of honour. Chosen woods are used for the
      ceiling. Also, much pains is taken for choosing “Shoji” paper doors
      for the rooms and “Fusuma” (paper doors between rooms,) to make the
      room an artistic and refined one.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
